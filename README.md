# TUM Slides Latex Template

This is a template for TUM slides. It is based on the latex template from a [TUM seminar](https://db.in.tum.de/teaching/ws2425/npic/). 

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository

2. Add your content to the `sections/` folder and modify the `main.tex` file to include your content.

3. Compile the document with `make`. 

4. Optionally, you can use `make watch` to automatically compile the document when you save your changes. 


## Branches

- `main`: Pushing to this branch will trigger a release.
- `draft`: Pushing to this branch will trigger a draft pdf artifact.
